    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "This project seeks to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired on my path to a Data Science Specialization with Coursera. I will attempt to solve a simulated real-world problem entirely with Python, employing various web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization and machine learning techniques. Within the code, I will utilize data returned through API calls to Foursquare to meet the requirements of this assignment. \n",

    "All code will be written in Python, tested and published from a Jupyter Notebook within Watson Studio on IBM Cloud. The code will be made available on Github through the links provided at the end of this exercise.\n"

    "## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This project will attempt to solve to the problem of selecting the ideal number and locations for Warehouses or Distribution Centers. This question often emerges at some point in the growth of a business whether it is expending across a county, state or nation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Picking the best locations for a distribution center can, among other things, reduce cost, improve efficiency, reduce lead time on fulfillment of orders, reduce length of delivery routes and therefore lower driver risk & insurance costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, too few or poorly located distribution centers can overload workers, increase overtime pay, reduce productivity, lengthen delivery routes, increase cost of delivery, increase delivery times and risking spoilage if the product is of a perishable nature. \n"

    "### PROBLEM SCENARIO\n",
    "A supplier of daily meals to High School Cafeterias across Orange County-Florida has just been awarded the contract to supply all schools within a specified area, defined within a 20mile radius of county center. To fulfill this contract, he will need to expand his food preparation and storage facilities as well as strategically position them to permit dependable and timely delivery considering the perishable nature of the product (food).\n"

    "## BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequently encountered problem within the business world among medium to large businesses seeking to expand their distribution networks. The question of how many and where to setup distribution centers can greatly impact the bottom line of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the question answers itself through trial and error with companies selecting locations within the general vicinity of its most frequent clients. Unfortunately, as they expand they could experience the ill effects of too few or poorly located distribution centers before a decision is made to take corrective action. The hope is that action is taken before customer are lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simple answer to such a problem is one of picking central locations among groups of customers and can be broken down into the following broad steps;\n",
    "i. Pinpoint the delivery locations of all customers\n",
    "ii. Gather these customers into groups \n",
    "iii. Finding the central location among these groups\n",
    "\n",
    "With the variety of libraries and modules available within Python, this problem is apt for a programmatic solution through data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches and solutions to this question. Many involved suggestions and discussions can be found through a simple web search (sample links provided below). My approach focuses only on geographical data for the relatively small scale of the problem scenario.\n"

    "\n",
    "This project and approach should be of interest to businesses seeking to expand storage, warehousing or distribution facilities to meet customer demands across large areas; cross county, state or country. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation, while simple, explores the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to provide an answer to a common business question. This key limitation here is available data. The larger the collection of related factors, the greater the potential insights from leveraging data science techniques.\n"

    "Foursquare popularized the concept of location sharing back in 2009 and today leverages the location data collected to serve approximately 150,000 partners through their developer tools.

The figure1 below shows a sample of the web based search results.\n"
